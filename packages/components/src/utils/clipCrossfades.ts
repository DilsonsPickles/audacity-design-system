 *  - PARTIAL EDGE overlap (each clip has material outside the shared

 *    out across the shared region while the later one fades in
 *    (equal-power). Symmetric — z does not affect the audio.
 *  - CONTAINMENT (one clip's span entirely inside the other's,
 *    including identical spans) = occlusion: the top (higher-z) clip
 *    simply plays; the covered region of the lower clip is silent.
 *    No fades are synthesized.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from clip geometry — a crossfade has no
